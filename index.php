    An educational computer game with the goal of increasing math fluency for 3rd graders. Using Common Core guidelines, the team plans to implements a rhythm-game where the player will solve simple math problems to increase their score. By using timed windows for responses, our goal is to reinforce fundamental skills and increase the players confidence in their own capabilities. In the long term, we hope the increased accessability of early math courses will result in an increased interest in STEM fields.
