                    An educational computer game with the goal of increasing math fluency for 3rd graders. Using Common
                    Core guidelines, the team plans to implements a rhythm-game where the player will solve simple math
                    problems to increase their score. By using timed windows for responses, our goal is to reinforce
                    fundamental skills and increase the players confidence in their own capabilities. In the long term,
                    we hope the increased accessability of early math courses will result in an increased interest in
                    STEM fields.

                    Currently, Tap Tap Computation supports four stages that users can progress through to practice math 
                    skills. Those four stages include Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division. Keeping within 
                    the constraints of the U.S. Department of Education Standards, this game is intended for users (be it
                    parents or students) interested in teaching and learning 3rd grade mathematical concepts. Players have
                    the benefit of being able to save their progress and resume later, as well as keeping track
                    of their high scores to incentivise learning through repitition. Since each question on each level is
                    randomly generated, Tap Tap Computation offers infinite replayability.

                    In the future, T-Six Games plans on implementing more difficult stages such as fractions and fill-in-the-blank 
                    to help players with complex numbers and algebra. Multiplayer and online rankings are within 
                    the scope of future development, too, allowing fans of Tap Tap Computation to compare their scores with  
                    others around the world. Co-op mode also will give players a fun way to practice their math skills with their 
                    friend, making learning math a fun and engaging experience!
