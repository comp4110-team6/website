            <li>Brainstormed ideas for the game itself.</li>
            <li>Landed on a 'catch the beat' style game akin to DDR where there are falling 'orbs' that the player must catch to gain a score.</li>
            <li>There will be a mathematical expression at the top of the screen (such as 3 - 2) and orbs of different integer values will fall for the player to catch.</li>
            <li>If the player catches the correct orb (in this case, the one reading '1'), they will earn points.</li>
            <li>The goal of this game is to give children in 3rd grade a way to practice math concepts such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, unknown values, and fractions as per the Common Core learning standard. </li>
            <li>Discussed deadlines and when to meet them, a draft of the project proposal was created as well as content to fill it. More collaborative work to be done via Office 365 by Tuesday night for our initial submission.</li>
            <li>Roles were assigned to each member. Jack Summers is promoted to Project Manager.</li>
            <li>Group members will also fill in their portion of the website, with headshots and member descriptions.</li>
            <li>Discord names exchanged and a new group chat was set up for easier access and file sharing. Meeting concluded after this </li>
